don't make it data-rel= "external" because that loads to a web browser instead of app

each new level is a, b, etc.

twitter bootstrap isn't the best because it doesn't work well with mobile

jquery ui demo


PROBLEMS:

- profile isn't working correctly
	> profile button doesn't display
	> haven't assigned guest to be empty (do I need to do that?)
- pictures aren't showing up on index
- location is displaying incorrect information to user (# of comments, etc.)


In fav:
	> want to determine whether user is logged in or is a guest
	> if guest, show popup that asks them to login on profile tab
	> if logged in, highlight star in yellow and add location id to favs table
